        "As a child, I never had the opportunity of being confortable with my physical image, growing up in a family with lack of education in terms of healthy lifestyle habits, I was always considered heavy. After some resilientful times, I was able to shift reality into a more healthy lifestyle, achieving the opposite.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of my favorite exercises, \"Ab Wheels\" or \"Ab Rollers\", as someone who was very overweight, and never had the opportunity of being \"visually healthy\", this exercise significantly helped with my core development.\n",
        "\n",
        "This personal journey also brought up a technical curiosity. After encountering a LinkedIn post showcasing an AI-powered push-up counter built with similar libraries, this inspired me to explore how these computer vision and machin learning techniques could be applied to the ab wheel, into creating a real-time tracking system.\n",
        "\n",
        "With these main motivations, my goal is to build tools that can better the health of individuals.\n",

        "## Project Goal & Functionalities\n",
        "This project aims to build a **real-time system** that accurately counts repetitions of the **kneeled ab wheel exercise** using a standard webcam feed. It serves as a robust prototype for an AI-powered fitness tracker, demonstrating advanced computer vision and state machine logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "The prototype provides:\n",
        "* **Real-time Pose Estimation:** Visualizes body landmarks during the exercise.\n",
        "* **Accurate Repetition Counting:** Tracks and counts completed reps.\n",
        "* **Robust Error Handling:** Distinguishes between full reps, partial reps, stalled movements, and lost poses.\n",
        "* **Live Visual Feedback:** Displays hip angle, current rep count, and exercise state.\n",
        "* **Session Recording:** Captures the entire annotated workout session into a video file for review.\n",

        "## Key Features & Technical Highlights\n",
        "* **Core Technology:** Leverages **MediaPipe Pose** for highly accurate real-time human pose estimation.\n",
        "* **Smart State Machine:** Implements a sophisticated state machine (READY, EXTENDING, EXTENDED, RETRACTING, RECOVERY) to precisely track rep phases.\n",
        "* **Hysteresis & Timeout Logic:** Utilizes distinct thresholds and time-based checks to prevent false counts from minor body movements, accidental stalls, or incomplete reps. Includes a dedicated `RECOVERY` state for explicit reset after failed attempts.\n",
        "* **Video Processing:** Integrates `OpenCV` for frame manipulation and `FFmpeg` (via subprocess) for robust video recording and stitching of annotated frames.\n",
        "* **Colab Environment:** Designed and optimized for execution within Google Colaboratory, supporting GPU acceleration for performance.\n",

        "To experience the AI-Powered Ab Wheel Repetition Counter yourself:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Open in Google Colab:**\n",
        "    * Go to `colab.research.google.com`.\n",
        "    * Click `File > Open notebook > GitHub`.\n",
        "    * Paste your repository URL: `https://github.com/machkevds/ab-roller-rep-counter-machkevds`.\n",
        "    * Select the main notebook file.\n",
        "2.  **Set Up Runtime:**\n",
        "    * Once the notebook loads, change the runtime type to `GPU` for optimal performance: `Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU > Save`.\n",
        "3.  **Grant Webcam Permissions:**\n",
        "    * When you run the main code cell, your browser will prompt for webcam access. **You MUST grant this permission.**\n",
        "4.  **Run the Notebook:**\n",
        "    * Execute all cells sequentially. The primary execution is within the \"Live Webcam Repetition Counter\" cell.\n",
        "    * The system will start capturing from your webcam, display the live processed feed, and record it to a video file.\n",
        "5.  **User Instructions during Live Session:**\n",
        "    * **Position yourself sideways** to the camera, ensuring your full body (from knees to head) is visible.\n",
        "    * **Initial Setup:** Get into your kneeling ab wheel starting position and **hold it still for about 1-3 seconds** until the `State` overlay changes from `INITIAL_SETUP` to `READY`.\n",
        "    * **Perform Reps:** Execute your ab wheel rollouts. The `Reps` count will increment, and the `State` will update.\n",
        "    * **Test Edge Cases:** Deliberately try:\n",
        "        * Stalling at the `EXTENDED` position for >3 seconds.\n",
        "        * Performing a partial rollout.\n",
        "        * Briefly moving out of frame.\n",
        "    * **Stop the Session:** Click the square \"Stop\" button on the Colab cell to end the recording.\n",
        "6.  **Download Your Recorded Session:**\n",
        "    * After the session stops, a video file (`final_recorded_session.mp4`) will be generated. You can download it from the Colab file browser (folder icon on left sidebar).\n",
